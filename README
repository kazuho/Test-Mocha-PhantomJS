NAME
    Test::Mocha::PhantomJS - test your server code using mocha

SYNOPSIS
      use Test::Mocha::PhantomJS;

      test_mocha_phantomjs(
          server => sub {
              my $port = shift;
              # start server at $port that returns the test code
              # for mocha-phantomjs
              ...
          },
      );

DESCRIPTION
    Test::Mocha::PhantomJS is a wrapper of mocha-phantomjs. By using the
    module, it is easy to automatically test your server-side logic simply
    by writing the tests written using mocha.

USAGE
  test_mocha_phantomjs(%args)
    This is the only function exposed by the module. When called, the
    function invokes the "server" callback, and when the server starts up,
    invokes mocha-phantomjs to run the test scripts. Note that the function
    never returns.

    The arguments accepted by the function is as follows.

   server (mandatory)
    A callback to start the server. The callback should start a server
    running at the specilied port (notified as the only argument to the
    callback) that should keep on running until a SIGTERM is being received.

   build_uri (optional)
    A callback for building the URL that is opened by mocha-phantomjs. If
    omitted, mocha-phantomjs will open http://127.0.0.1:$port/index.html.

   max_wait (optional)
    Will wait for at most given seconds before checking port. See also:
    Net::EmptyPort. The default value is 10 (seconds).

   auto_skip (optional)
    A boolean value indicating if the test should be skipped in case
    mocha-phantomjs cannot be found. The default value is false (i.e. do not
    skip).
